                It is so important to first and foremost take a moment to think about the kind of wedding day that truly feels like you. Do you envision a lively celebration, surrounded by loved ones, filled with laughter, energy, and unforgettable moments? Or maybe you're the type to elope on your own terms, keep it simple, focus on each other, and capture some beautiful photos along the way. However you choose to celebrate your love, make sure it’s a reflection of what matters most to you both.
